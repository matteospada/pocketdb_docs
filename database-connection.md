# Getting Started

## Login

The first step is to log in to Pocket DB using your Notion account. To do this, simply click on "Login with Notion" at the top of the homepage.

You will be asked for permission to access your account information. Pocket DB requires the following permissions to function properly:

- Read your Full Name and email address to authenticate your account.
- Read and write to your Notion databases to allow you to interact with them via API.

Click on Allow and then select the databases to which you want to grant permissions. You can always modify your choices within the Account section.

**Note: If you remove permissions from a database previously added to Pocket DB, the integration will immediately stop working.**

## Adding the First Database

Connecting a Notion database is straightforward. Simply click on Add database and then select the database you want to add by clicking the "Add DB" button.

If you don't find the database you are looking for in the list, make sure you have provided the necessary permissions by clicking on review permissions, or ensure that the page you want to add is indeed a Notion database.
